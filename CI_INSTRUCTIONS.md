GitHub Actions CI added.

- Workflow: .github/workflows/build.yml
- The workflow will try to use gradlew if present; otherwise it will create a wrapper in CI.
- If your project requires a specific Gradle/AGP version, please add gradle/wrapper files from your development environment.
- Push to main/master to trigger the build.
